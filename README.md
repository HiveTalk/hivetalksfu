<summary>Host Protection Configuration</summary>

<br/>

When [host.protected](https://docs.mirotalk.com/mirotalk-sfu/host-protection/) or `host.user_auth` is enabled, the host/users can provide a valid token for direct joining the room as specified in the `app/src/config.js` file.

| Params           | Value                                                                            | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host.protected` | `true` if protection is enabled, `false` if not (default false)                  | Requires the host to provide a valid username and password during room initialization. |
| `host.user_auth` | `true` if user authentication is required, `false` if not (default false).       | Determines whether host authentication is required.                                    |
| `host.users`     | JSON array with user objects: `{"username": "username", "password": "password"}` | List of valid host users with their credentials.                                       |

Example:

```js
    host: {
        protected: true,
        user_auth: true,
        users: [
            {
                username: 'username',
                password: 'password',
            },
            {
                username: 'username2',
                password: 'password2',
            },
            //...
        ],
    },
```
